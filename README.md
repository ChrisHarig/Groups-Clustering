# Groups-Clustering

## Description
A small k-means-clustering project intended to divide swimmers in to training groups

## Limitations
This was developed specifically for short course yards times. 
The currect file paths and names only work if the data is in ./best_times in seperate csv's for each swimmer (named 'FirstLast.csv') with just event names ('50 Y Free'), and Times in min:sec.mili
